Is this thing on? Really.

I am learning GatsbyJS and building pages programmatically. It's so much fun. This is some gibberish I am writing to see if it shows up in the excerpt because Gatsby seems to automatically generate the excerpt and I'm not sure how it does it or what kind of constraints it uses to do so. So this is just some emergency spaz writing and what will I actually blog about when I blog properly? I am expecting that I will create three posts and then maybe only post once every 1-2 weeks or so or maybe even once a month who knows we'll see when we get there if we get there will we get there?
