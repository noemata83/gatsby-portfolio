For this project, I developed a template-driven, custom CMS with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to serve as the backend for a revamped Rosspens.com. The original Rosspens site was developed in the late 1990s; the proprietor was eager to move beyond working with temperamental WYSIWYG editors, and also eager to move off of overpriced hosting. I was eager to see what I could build "from the ground up" in fullstack JavaScript. The site now dynamically displays the Rosspens collection, allows for the dynamic creation of static pages, and handles scalable image uploads through AWS-S3--all powered by a secure, custom admin interface.
