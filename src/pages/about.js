            I am a freelance full-stack web developer based in Hillsborough, NC. I build web applications using the latest frontend technologies, including React.js, and develop
            backend architectures in Node.js and Django. I enjoy working with a variety of clients, including small businesses and non-profits. But I am especially eager to help research entities use the power of the web to convey
            their findings to the general public. <br />
            <br />
            Before I became a developer, I taught philosophy at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, VA. I lectured about ethics and wrote about the German existentialists. I am also
            a sometime enthusiast photographer.<br />
