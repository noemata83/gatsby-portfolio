            I am a freelance full-stack web developer. I build websites using the latest technologies, and develop
            server architectures in Node.js and Django.

            Before I became a developer, I taught philosophy at the College of William and Mary. While there, 
            I taught ethics and wrote about the history of 20th-century German Philosophy. It was fun until it wasn't.
