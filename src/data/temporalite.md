When I was working as an academic, I often longed to find an intuitive, effective time and project management app: something that would help me work consistently and effectively during the precious unstructured time of summer months. More recently, I have been thinking about issues of equity around the distribution of labor responsibilities in homes and workplaces,. Temporalite responds to these issues, by offering the user a toolkit of ways to enter, track, and visualize their time usage. It also provides a project management dashboard (currently, basically a todo-list). As I continue to build out the app, I look forward to adding task categorization, collaboration functionality and more robust data visualization.
