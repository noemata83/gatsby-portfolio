When I was working as an academic, I often longed to find an intuitive, effective time and project management app: something that would help me work more consistently and effectively, especially during the precious unstructured work time availed by the summer months. More recently, I have been thinking about the distribution of labor responsibilities in homes and workplaces, and how to make that distribution more equitable and fair. Temporalite responds to these issues, by offering the user a toolkit of ways to enter, track, and visualize their time usage. It also provides a project management dashboard (currently, basically a todo-list). As I continue to build out the app, I look forward to adding task categorization, collaboration functionality and more robust data visualization.
