This project collects a suite of small apps I built to learn how to implement the functional programming paradigm in JavaScript. This project mainly uses vanilla JavaScript, although it does call upon the aid of several helper libraries to automate DOM manipulation. In addition to offering several examples of apps written entirely in the functional style, this project also provided me with my first exposure to the Tachyons CSS framework, which I've slowly come to love for its versatility and simplicity.
