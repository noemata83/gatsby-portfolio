I built this, my portfolio site, using GatsbyJS. GatsbyJS is a static site generator built upon React, with a GraphQL data layer interface. The site uses a Gatsby plugin to dynamically generate both project entries and blog posts from Markdown files, making the site flexible and extensible. To style the site, I again called upon the Tachyons CSS library. The photography is my own.
