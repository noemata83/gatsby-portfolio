For this project, I developed a template-driven, custom CMS with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to serve as the backend for a revamped Rosspens.com. I was eager to see what I could build "from the ground up" in fullstack JavaScript. The site now dynamically displays the Rosspens collection, allows for the dynamic creation of static pages, and handles scalable image uploads through AWS-S3--all overseen by a custom admin interface.
